# boggle

Written in C++ in the QTCreator IDE.

Program’s graphics are in the gboggle.cpp file; functionality and logic are in the Boggle.cpp file. Both files are under the “src” directory.

The gameplay is separated into two screens: the console — where the player indicates his/her move - and the game board.
